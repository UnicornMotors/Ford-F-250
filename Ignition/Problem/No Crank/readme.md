# Description
The batterys are good, the alternator is good, the starter is good but when I turn the key all I can hear is the solenoid click, I have tried cleaning the terminals on the starter and solenoid and batterys. What do I do?

# Diagnostic:
The Motorcraft positive engagement starter motor is used on all engines except the 4.0L and 7.3L Diesel. The starter system also includes a starter (ignition) switch, relay, neutral start switch (A/T) or clutch interlock switch (M/T), battery and heavy circuit wiring.
When the ignition switch is turned to the START position, the starter relay is actuated through the starter control circuit. This connects the starter motor to battery, permitting current to flow through the grounded field coil, actuating a movable pole shoe. See Fig. 1. The pole shoe forces the starter drive plunger lever to engage the starter and flywheel gears.
