# Problem: "When I turn the key the dash lights usually come on and then the starter does not engage when the key is rotated to the start position. The vehicle will start if the solenoid is jumped so I believe the problem is in the column."

## Solved!
"Well, I finally did what I should have done from the start. I used my trouble shooting and diagnostic skills to run down the entire ignition system. I found the Ignition module at the dist. Was getting proper voltage but not firing the dist. I replaced the module and presto. End of problem. Found out after I fixed it everyone suddenly remembers that it was/is a common problem with these vehicles. Gotta love those after-the-fact experts."
