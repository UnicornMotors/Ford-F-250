quote: "They do adjust with the parking brake. Take a look at the parking brake arm. When the arm is pulled the self adjuster cable is also pulled at the top fulcrum. This causes the spring loaded adjuster to lift and rotate the star wheel. If no adjustment is needed the tension is taken up by the smaller spring in the adjustment arm to prevent the cable from stretching."
