Ok guys, I wanted to follow up with this. This axle nut requires a 2-9/16" Round Hex Nut Socket Napa part number KD-2436. It should cost between $20-$35 depending on who you get it from.

Also, tightening it requires turning the drum as you tighten it down to 120-140 ft/lbs, then back it off 1/8-3/8 of a turn which allows a slight end play. Then lock in a new locking wedge so that the axle nut can never come off.

For a final note, the axle shaft retaining bolts require a 40-50 ft/lbs of torque with brand new gaskets. I hope this post helps somebody else, but the most important thing is to get the ROUND Hex Socket, otherwise it will never fit.
