>That model is the F-250 Light Duty...it's not a GVWR of 8800 lbs.

>That is the lightest model by far.

>My 89 F-250 351 4x4 reg cab long bed was 5300.

>The supercab is about 200, the long bed vs short bed is about 150, the 4wd vs 2wd is about 250-300, the 351 has about 60-75 lbs on a 302, not sure what the 460 or diesel weigh but the diesel is heavy.

>I'd say a safe estimate is 5500 lbs on a small block version truck, and about 6000-6500 on a 460/diesel setup. Safe estimates.

>My dad had an 88 F-250 supercab 351/c6/4wd long bed with a heavy duty steel Reading top on the back of it. I think it weighed around 800 lbs.

>He broke down one day and had to get towed, a typical flatbed truck with the slide out deck and rear car hauler under the back, single dually rear axle, F-650 size (not sure what make) truck came to get him. He slid the ramp down and winched my dad's truck up from the front. When the truck got far enough, it was so heavy that it lifted the front wheels of the tow truck off the ground.

>This truck had to have an international or other big diesel in it, PTO driven hydraulics, everything. He had to use the car hauler under the back to hold the truck down. Once he had it up there the front bumper was up to the back of the truck and the rear wheels were about 6" off the end of the ramp. It really was a huge truck to have on even that big of a tow truck. It was a pretty cool experience.

>Never had it weighed but I think we figured it to be about 6500-6800 lbs with the cap.
