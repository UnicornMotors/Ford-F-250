I've been working on vehicles for going on 15 years at Walmart. We always put anti-seize on the studs before putting the lugnuts on. I've never had one come lose yet.
You just have to hand torque the lugnuts to the factory specs then retorque them at 50 miles and they stay in place.
The old F250 truck would have a lugnut torque of about 160 ft/lbs. 
We would do 2 hand torques, drive the vehicle in a figure 8 pattern and do 1 more hand torque, then recommend retorquing at 50 miles. The biggest issue we run into is lugnuts that were overtightened, then locked on by rust. The next biggest issue we run into is having a vehicle in that hadn't had the tires regularly rotated, and the rims are seized up on the hubs.

 @dannyo66  Err on the side of caution or defer to the expert, in this case you. I will gladly secede from my previous comment in deference to your superior knowledge. Thanks for the info.

​ @Navnit Kumar  

It is quite fine. As anything that is a safety issue deserves closer analysis. I've already learned Lessons on that - and i have Checklists before I go anywhere, or on the highway with others, in these old Beaters.

 @dannyo66  Thanks man. I just watch the other Mechanic channels like ViceGripGarage, Deboss, WatchWesWork, Scotty Kilmer etc. & try to learn from the best. Sometimes I just do a little Trial & Error? Like try to use cheap petroleum Grease, vs. a specialty product formula

I have a 3/4 Breaker and a 4 ft long pole I slide over it and use to multiply torqure. which is probably close to that spec.

I don't have any intention to be a "real" or Licensed Mechanic. I'm Just trying to see what we can do with old machines? in a Collapsed Economy. I'm quite comfortable in tech (15 yrs).. and don't want to change careers any time soon. This is more like therapy to me..

Appreciate everything You do! and have bought Tires from you guys several times.

Anti seize and grease are very different just saying.

 @Kalash Nikov  Yeah, but the purpose is more to keep water from wicking into the grain. any hydrophobic oil will work. this is just a 2¢ fix. See Project Farm, he's does experiments:

 @Kalash Nikov  Granted, but both are providing a lubricating coating and preventing seizing of the lugnut.

 @dannyo66  anti seize does not lubricate. That's the benefit of it, use antiseize where is not supposed to be any friction but you may want to preserve it and have ease of removing it later.

 @Unicorn Coin  We have had situations where we had to put a bar on a breaker to get enough leverage to break loose a stuck lugnut too. It definitely does happen. Always torque with a torque wrench when reinstalling the lugnuts. 

Asian imports:
Toyota cars-76 ft/lbs.
Toyota pickups/suv-83-97 
Nissan cars-80 ft/lbs.
Nissan pickups/suv-95 ft/lbs.
Mazda cars-80 ft/lbs.
Mazda pickups/suv-100 ft/lbs.
Hyundai/Kia cars-80 ft/lbs.
Subaru all-80 ft/lbs.

American:
Chevy cars-100 ft/lbs.
Chevy/GMC pickups/suv-140 ft/lbs.
Dodge cars-100 ft/lbs.
Dodge pickups/suv-130 ft/lbs.
Ford cars-100 ft/lbs.
Ford pickups/suv-150 ft/lbs 1/2 ton
Ford pickups/suv-160 ft/lbs 3/4 and 1 ton.

That should cover the vast majority of any lugnut torque specs out there someone would encounter.

 @dannyo66  When I got it, it was definitely over 200 ft lbs to break lose, and had sat & rusted for years... as I had to stand and jump on a 3/4 breaker with about 4 ft radius extension. and I weight 135 so that's 540 ft lbs est.

The previous owner or his "Mechanic" completely destroyed the front studs. Each side has only 4 & 5 of 8 lugs with the threads torn & shredded off like peeling an orange.

I'm going to have to address that problem next.

Maybe I'm overreacing with thread grease? But i've never seen damage like this. I'm from a Non-Salt state.

 @Unicorn Coin  Me too. North Dakota doesn't put salt on the roads. And I have seen this situation too. 
We even have had some instances where we had to decline the tire service because we just couldn't get the lugnuts off. We don't get high end extreme torque impact wrenches for removing lugnuts, so there are situations where they are not removable with our tools. In those cases, we have to tell the customer to take the vehicle to another shop to have them removed, then replace any broken/damaged studs, and then bring it back so we can service it for them. It happens. 
I suspect the shop they end up taking them to would have to split open the lugnuts to get them off.

​ @dannyo66  Tim's has a family member with a car, that the "Professional" Tire Service literally broke off the stud inside the Rotor, and didn't fix or pay to replace it...

And this is a Front Wheel Drive wheel, and Steering on a small asian car that only has 4 studs to begin with...

When I saw that I was astonished.
Has a replacement vehicle now, but that blew my mind. It's still not fixed. Going to try to go help..

Talk about Unlimited Liability?

 @dannyo66  ​ @dannyo66  
Exactly.
And Sucks to hear you experience this Regularly at work.

Unscrupulous shops will just use Impacts until they break it, because it saves them Time. and they're paid by the hour... Noone cares about the quality? if they're not getting compensated for it.

I already stripped a stud on my other E-350 trying to get one off with a 850 lb Electric impact.. I really hate Impacts to be honest. I prefer to just use Giant breakers with a Fence Post as a lever. Literally. Everytime you do this, the threads get weaker & weaker, and more worn down every time you remove it. Eventually they'll break away or won't have enough friction to hold... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tribology

I don't often explain my chain of thought, in the moment. but That's the reason I don't use Impacts, and grease my threads, and know what 200 ft lbs approx. feels like. And prefer to just do road checklist regularly, than assume it's going to be one & done.  (Until press out & re-stud all my wheels)

It's not shown, but Yes I retorque to 200 ft lbs after we lower it... episodes have to be short. I've been changing & rotating tires a long time. Not like this is my first car/truck

 @Unicorn Coin  No, if you've been doing it for 15 years yourself, I'm sure you've seen plenty of this in your time too. I'm by no means an expert, not even a school trained mechanic so you've probably got that one up on me and I'd defer to your experience on mechanic issues. I'd never attempt a brake job on one of these trucks without someone else being there who knows what they are doing. 
At Walmart we don't do "mechanic" services on vehicles, just oil changes and tire work and maybe a battery or 2, but precious little else.
Personally, I've got a 99 Chevy Silverado with a water pump replacement as my next project. I've been waiting for a warmer day and all to even attempt it. Got new hoses and idler pulleys and a new serpentine belt to replace to complete the project. Yep I'm going to be reviewing a few youtube videos on how to do it too before I start.

 @dannyo66  ​ I've been doing computer programming, linux, & hw engineering (with a side course of networking) since about 2006.
Only started / felt compelled to Start trying to learn mechanic skills this year... because of Biden-nomics stagflation

my dad taught me how to tear down & rebuild engines, gokarts from lawnmower motors, weld, hydraulic jacks, & paint and clearcoat and stuff since i was ~5-14. Idk. he was about hands on science-type education. We were as blue collar as you go... 

But there's very big difference between that & actual Auto Mechanic work. Cars are, IMO 2 order of magnitude more complex! and I've not yet dipped into any car more recent than 2006.

 @Unicorn Coin  Anything newer is probably going to require buying specialized equipment to work on it. I'd say 2006 is a good stopping point. After that, you run into a huge amount of additional computer issues. Then on top of it, you have tire pressure monitoring systems to have to contend with. That's a subject I can go on all day about. :-)

​ @dannyo66  Exactly. Like I really don't want the latest & greatest. and cars / Diesel trucks are just a money pit.things. Age doesn't matter, hell A.C. doesn't even, to me. just mechanical soundness. It's at tool & utility, To do & move things. It's meant to be that and nothing else.. I don't like to be emotionally attached to posessions.

When this is all finished, and sold: my "Daily" will probably be a 1995-2003 F-350 with a 7.3 IDI Turbo engine & manual trans swap to replace the PowerStroke.

Right now the used car market is insanely Inflated. 145% over a year ago, and still going up... I came up here 1400 miles from home, in a 1995 "beater" I inherited, and broke down 35 miles from the castle. Took me three weeks and I couldn't secure a better truck. Fixed it on the side of the highway with CarQuest' help and limped it home, barely got here. So I said "Never again" I watched alot of Car Wizard, Scotty, & Hoovies Garage Tried to Learn how to Not get bitten...

But mainly Derek Bieri (ViceGripGarage) & Diesel Creek is what made me actually pull the trigger & buy one of these Trucks.

I Wish we could get one of the guys who are professional content creators & Fulltime Mechancs to come on the show! They also built their channel & career from nothing, the same way Tim did. some are pretty conservative as well... (is it really that Bad, to be public about one's views?)

 @Unicorn Coin  No argument there. I've seen what the outcome of all that is. The newer Chevy Silverado's are now a shadow of what my 99 is. Even with a bad water pump I wouldn't trade mine even up for any Silverado newer than 06.
