I've been working on vehicles for going on 15 years at Walmart. We always put anti-seize on the studs before putting the lugnuts on. I've never had one come lose yet.
You just have to hand torque the lugnuts to the factory specs then retorque them at 50 miles and they stay in place.
The old F250 truck would have a lugnut torque of about 160 ft/lbs. 
We would do 2 hand torques, drive the vehicle in a figure 8 pattern and do 1 more hand torque, then recommend retorquing at 50 miles. The biggest issue we run into is lugnuts that were overtightened, then locked on by rust. The next biggest issue we run into is having a vehicle in that hadn't had the tires regularly rotated, and the rims are seized up on the hubs.
